# North Korea Missile Ranges

Generate a [D3](http://d3js.org/) spinning globe on canvas and animate it using scrollyteller waypoints.

A project generated from [aunty](http://github.com/abcnews/aunty)'s `preact-app` template.

Depends on [ABC's Odyssey Template](https://github.com/abcnews/odyssey).

The article is live now [on the ABC website](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-16/north-korea-missile-range-map/8880894).

## Configuration

Generate marker waypoints in CoreMedia with hashes like `#markIDnorthkoreaRANGE1000LABELguam`

Needs a JSON data file with your coordinates and names etc.

Note: this project is for use internally within the ABC. It will probably not work on its own, but you are welcome to have a look around.

A standalone working model of the globe interactive can be found [on Glitch here](https://glitch.com/~/nk).
